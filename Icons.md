**A vector graphic** consists of shapes, curves, lines, and text which together make a picture.  
While a **bitmap(Raster)** image contains information about the color of each pixel, a vector graphic contains  
instructions about where to place each of the components.

Vector graphics are digital art that is rendered by a computer using a mathematical formula.  
Raster images are made up of tiny pixels, making them resolution dependent and best used for creating photos.

## SVG

SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics, is a language for describing vector graphics in XML. With SVG, you can code graphics directly into an XML document

Vector graphics are not appropriate for complex images (e.g., digitized photographs).

## Raster(bitmap) graphic  

Raster images are compiled using pixels, or tiny dots, containing unique color and tonal information that come together to create the image.  
Since raster images are pixel based, they are resolution dependent.  
As you may have guessed, the more pixels in the image and the higher the resolution is, the higher quality the image will be.  
Use Photoshop for scaling
