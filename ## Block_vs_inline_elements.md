# Block versus inline elements

**Block-level elements** form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it.  
Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page.  
For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers.  
A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.

**Inline elements** are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the document's content  
(not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document.  
It is typically used with text, for example an <a> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <em> or <strong> create emphasis.
  
**There are two display values: block and inline**  
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available  
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
