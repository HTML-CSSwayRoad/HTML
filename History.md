### API  
 
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software  
program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface.  

In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g. methods, properties, events, and URLs) that  
a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser, or other software/hardware  
on the user's computer, or third party websites and services.
